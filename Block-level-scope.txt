Block-level Scope:

var outsideExample = "First string";
if (true) {
    var outsideExample = "Second string";
    console.log(outsideExample);
}
console.log(outsideExample);

The first console.log() obviously logs "Second string" as it comes right after we set the value of outsideExample to "Second string". But what about the second console.log()?

Remember, if statements do not create their own scope. Unlike the last quiz, where we created a totally new variable inside a function, the if statement does not create a new variable. It simply overwrites the value of outsideExample to "Second string".

So, the second time we console.log(), we see "Second string" again.
